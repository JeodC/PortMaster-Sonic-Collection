## Installation
Copy a rom of `Sonic 3 & Knuckles` to ports/sonic3air and rename it to `Sonic_Knuckles_wSonic3.bin`.

## Default Controls
Sonic 3 AIR runs entirely on SDL controls and plays like any other Sonic game. The only keyboard controls are tied to L1 and R1 to adjust the aspect ratio between 4:3 and 16:9.
