//# script-feature-level(2)

// Script feature levels
//  - Higher levels can introduce additional script language features, but can also be stricter in what is reported as an error by the compiler
//  - Level 1 is the original version (until Dec 2021)
//  - Changes for level 2:
//     - string as a dedicated type; no conversion from u64 to string is possible any more, but string to u64 is still fine
//     - the condition after 'if' must be put in parentheses, like in C/C++
